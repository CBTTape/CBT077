//***FILE 077 is from Brian Westerman of Syzygy, Inc. and contains  *   FILE 077

//*           work on the Hercules MVS 3.8J Turnkey system from     *   FILE 077
//*           Volker Bandke.  Many of these utilities came from     *   FILE 077
//*           old CBT Tapes, and some are found on Brian's other    *   FILE 077
//*           file, which is File 088.  But these utilities, in     *   FILE 077
//*           these versions, have been tested to run under         *   FILE 077
//*           Hercules, running MVS 3.8J, and for those people      *   FILE 077
//*           who are restricted to that system, these are as       *   FILE 077
