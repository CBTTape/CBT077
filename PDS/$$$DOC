Hi Sam,

Here is the first cut at the utilities.  I am sending you a
self-extracting zip file of the AWS format IEBCOPY tape of
the source PDS and also a PDF file of the contents.  It's
about 445KB in compressed (ZIP) format.  It contains source
members that I have loaded from old copies of my PDS's from
very old backup tapes.  Most of them were originally from
old versions of various SHARE and CBT tapes, but they have
all been tested on the Hercules MVS3.8 turnkey system.  I
will try to update this list frequently.

Also, does anyone have a digital copy of the old MVS manuals
that match this version of the operating system (MVS 3.8)?
If so, where can I find them?
